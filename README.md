# RAG-Agents: Building Intelligent Agents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Welcome to RAG-Agents, your guide to creating intelligent agents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. This repository provides Jupyter notebooks that empower you to integrate pre-trained models with external knowledge sources, enhancing your AI systems with robust capabilities for natural language understanding and generation.

## Notebooks Included

### 1. Rag_with_self_query_LLama_index.ipynb

Explore self-querying of the LLama index for document QA, ideal for scenarios with multi-stage documents where knowledge updates are crucial for accurate responses.

### 2. llamaindex_for_html_parsing.ipynb

Utilize RAG architecture to parse and comprehend HTML content, enabling intelligent information extraction and QA directly from HTML files.

### 3. reACT_agent_llama_index.ipynb

Implement the reACT agent framework to solve mathematical problems leveraging LLama index capabilities, enhancing computational reasoning and problem-solving tasks.
